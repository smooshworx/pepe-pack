# pepe-pack

Works on all models of Trident and V2.4

Named after the cartoon character. Felt it was a fitting name for something that takes the stink out. Plus I could not think of anything to continue the 'F'-pack naming scheme without going down a very fun but offensive path. 

****** PRINT AND STUDY ALL PARTS BEFORE DRILLING ANY HOLES!!! ******

Fanny/Funny Pack Remix with updated basket. I could not get a CAD file from the funny pack project so I took the smaller original fanny pack and stretched it again. Other key changes are:
  
  -Added more smaller cross bars to the basket. This creates a screen that will keep broken carbon pellets from falling into the fans.
  -Added WAY too many heat inserts to the perimeter of the main body. You don't have to use them all.
  -There are now 2 fan wire exits into the chamber depending on where your Z cable chain is.
  -The rear fan cover is thicker and has deeper wire tracks that can feed toward either end to utilize the 3 wire exits.

The drill guide will help with making sure everything lines up properly. You don't have to use all holes or any at all.

I will be adding more details, pictures, and maybe an install video in the near future. These will most likely be on my website which is about to go live. I have a lot more freedom with creating good, easy to follow content on there than I do on here.
